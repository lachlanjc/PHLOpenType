        About </h3>
        <p class="gcontent"> PHL OpenType is a growing collective of Philadelphia based designers seizing an opportunity to design for good while showing their love for the city they live in.
          Designers have volunteered to design a typeface inspired by various neighborhoods.  <br>
          Designers reasons for choosing those areas has varied from where they live currently, to what area they are from, to areas they want to explore further.
          The typefaces themselves look to celebrate all facets of life in the specific areas and provide viable typefaces for others to use on their own projects.
          These typefaces will then become available on a “Pay What You Can” price model with proceeds going directly to the neighborhoods they are designed after.
          The goal is to get a typeface for every neighborhood and have everyone represented in this project.
          This project is constantly moving and we are still in the planning stages but if your are interested in helping in any way possible, say hello! </p>
